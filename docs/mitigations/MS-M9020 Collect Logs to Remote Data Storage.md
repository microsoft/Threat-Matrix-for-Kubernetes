    MITRE mitigation: [M1029](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1029/)


Collect the Kubernetes and application logs of pods to external data storage to avoid tampering or deletion. This can be achieved by various open-source tools such as Fluentd. Also, built-in cloud solutions are available for managed clusters, such as Container Insights and Log Analytics in AKS and Cloud Logging in GKE.
