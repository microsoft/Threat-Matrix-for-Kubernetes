# Initial Access

The initial access tactic consists of techniques that are used for gaining access to the resource. In containerized environments, those techniques enable first access to the cluster. This access can be achieved directly via the cluster management layer or, alternatively, by gaining access to a malicious or vulnerable resource that is deployed on the cluster.
